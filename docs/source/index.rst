   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Kuha Class Management's documentation!
=================================================

**Kuha Class Management** is a hobby project I am developing to streamline and automate the process of taking student attendance. Each day students can sign in with the daily password and the current attendance can be downloaded for each class as a .csv file. It's still very much in the early stages, but I'm actively using it for all of my classes.
